/**
 * Manages all configuration for the Better Intra extension: the one public
 * entry point for settings. Every feature imports from here, never from
 * src/core/config/ directly.
 *
 * The pieces live in src/core/config/:
 *  - schema.ts    BetterIntraConfig and ConfigKey, the shape of every setting
 *  - defaults.ts  CONFIG_DEFAULT, the value of every setting never written
 *  - keys.ts      CLOUD_SYNC_KEYS and VISUAL_CLOUD_KEYS, what goes to the cloud
 *  - access.ts    getConfig(), getConfigMany(), setConfig() and normalisation
 *  - snapshot.ts  the in-memory settings snapshot behind the reads
 *
 * Importing this module also switches the snapshot on (last line), which is
 * why it must stay the entry point: see "Ordering" in snapshot.ts.
