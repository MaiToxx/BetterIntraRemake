/**
 * Clears what an earlier instance of Better Intra left in this tab, before
 * this instance mounts anything.
 *
 * WHY: when Firefox applies an add-on update (it checks about once a day and
 * installs at once) or the add-on is re-enabled, it tears the old content
 * script down and injects the new content.js into the Intra tabs that are
 * already open. The old script's DOM stays on the page, its listeners dead.
 * Our features guard their mounts by id or by a flag attribute, so the new
 * instance found the dead gear and Clusters button and skipped its own, and
 * the features guarded per instance (friends widget, theme links) mounted a
 * second copy. With the leftovers gone, every feature mounts fresh, working
 * nodes through its normal init.
 *
 * main.ts imports this module first and the work runs at import time: module
 * bodies run in import order, so no other module's top-level code, and none
 * of main.ts's start-up code, can have added a node before it.
 *
 * Chrome never injects into open tabs on update (the orphaned script keeps
 * running there, see hubSettings.ts), so this finds nothing to do on Chrome.
