# Performance

What Better Intra costs on an Intra page, what it gives back, and how to keep
the numbers from creeping up.

## What it costs today

Measured on the minified v1.12.0 build (`npm run measure`, `dist-firefox`;
`dist-chrome` is the same output with a different manifest):

| file                 |      raw |     gzip | loaded                                   |
| -------------------- | -------: | -------: | ---------------------------------------- |
| `content.js`         | 575.8 KB | 173.1 KB | on every `*.intra.42.fr` page            |
| `shared-styles.css`  | 128.4 KB |  20.0 KB | once, then served from cache             |
| `theme-dark-v2.css`  |  62.4 KB |  10.4 KB | only on the old v2 Intra                 |
| `popup.js`           |  39.9 KB |  13.1 KB | when the popup opens                     |
| `shared-themes.css`  |  37.5 KB |   6.1 KB | only with a preset other than light/dark |
| `theme-dark-v3.css`  |  12.3 KB |   2.1 KB | with the dark theme on v3                |
| `theme-light-v3.css` |  10.0 KB |   1.6 KB | with a light theme preset                |
| `auth-callback.js`   |   9.8 KB |   4.3 KB | on the worker callback page              |
| `hook.js`            |   4.2 KB |   1.4 KB | in the page's own world, at document_start |
| `background.js`      |   2.7 KB |   1.3 KB | once per browser session                 |

Raw is the number that matters. An extension file is read from disk, never
downloaded, so nothing un-gzips it: what the browser pays on an Intra page load
is parsing `content.js`.

### Unreleased

- **The milestone ring no longer runs a script per frame.** The dashboard's
  current milestone had a `requestAnimationFrame` loop writing `--angle` on
  every frame for as long as the tab was open: 3,750 wake-ups a minute, none
  of them in the table above, so the real dashboard figure was about eight
  times the 465 measured. The ring is now a CSS animation on a registered
  `@property`, stopped by `prefers-reduced-motion` and by Disable animations
  (`tests/timers.test.ts`, row "milestones: ring angle": 3,750 -> 0).
- **The profile-card stylesheet stays put.** It was removed and re-inserted on
  every profile pass, which invalidated the styles of the whole document each
  time (`tests/runtime-perf.test.ts`).
- **Profile stats read the v2 pages three at a time** and the history page
  together with the first feedback page, instead of up to 16 pages one after
  the other; the walk stops at the first empty page. Writing that cache no
  longer copies the whole storage area into the tab: the cleanup of the keys
  older builds left runs in the background, once per update.
- **One GitHub request per six hours**, conditional (`If-None-Match`), stored
  with its time; the popup and the hub read the stored result and make no
  request of their own. The About tab no longer fetches the star and follower
  counts from `api.github.com`.

### What changed in 1.12.0

`content.js` grew by 19 KB (556.5 to 575.8 KB) with this release's fixes:
accessible names and keyboard handling in the hub and on the profile, the
friends widget's failure states, the stale-if-error caches and the cleanup
after an add-on update. Measured with the Firefox harness against 1.11.1
(`npm run smoke:firefox -- --compare`, 3 cold and 10 warm loads each), the
app's first writes and the hub's opening times did not move (every median
within 1 ms on warm loads).

### What changed in 1.11.0

| | v1.10.0 | v1.11.0 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `content.js` | 606.7 KB | 556.5 KB |
| Tailwind CSS parsed on a default-theme page | 300.7 KB | 127.4 KB |
| storage reads before the profile page is usable | about 50 | 1 |
| timer wake-ups per minute, tab visible / in background | 726 / 395 | 465 / 66 |

- **Settings snapshot.** Every `getConfig` used to be one round trip to the extension process. Each context (page, popup, service worker) now loads the settings once and keeps them exact through `storage.onChanged` and a write-through on its own writes. `src/core/config/snapshot.ts` explains the design and its fallback.
- **A leaner stylesheet.** Tailwind was scanning the whole repository (tests, docs, an agent skill file) and generating rules nothing uses; it scans `src/` only now. Eight daisyUI components nothing uses are out, and 33 duplicated theme blocks were collapsed. The 34 theme presets other than light and dark live in `shared-themes.css`, fetched only when one is picked. Checked in Chromium against the previous sheet on every theme: no computed value changed.
- **Dead code out.** Discord reminders, the students directory, worker image upload and the Outstanding star need a 42 API application this fork does not have; they were removed after checking the worker side.
- **No polling left.** Waits are observers with a deadline; clocks and countdowns pause while the tab is hidden. 1.13.0 removed the three loops that had survived: the perf sheet's hunt for the logtime root (20 x 500 ms on every page), the subject tracker's wait for its PDF link (40 x 150 ms on every project page) and the document_start avatar observer that watched every page for its lifetime.

### What changed in 1.10.0

| | v1.9.1 | v1.10.0 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `content.js` | 968.9 KB | 606.7 KB |
| `popup.js` | 334.6 KB | 34.4 KB |
| Tailwind sheet parsed per page | 9 times (once per shadow root) | once |

The Tailwind + daisyUI sheet used to be a 300 KB string inside the JavaScript,
in **both** bundles, and it was concatenated into the `<style>` of every widget.
Each widget's text differed slightly, so the engine's identical-text cache
missed and it parsed those 300 KB again for every shadow root. Measured in
Chrome on nine roots: **54.4 ms** of style work, against **3.2 ms** when the
same sheet is a single constructable `CSSStyleSheet` shared by all of them.

It is now a real file (`shared-styles.css`) that the browser fetches once,
parses once and caches. `src/core/styles/shared-styles.ts` hands it out two ways, and
the difference matters:

- `adoptSharedStyles(root, extraCSS?)` — adopted sheets apply **after** a
  root's own `<style>`, so this is only for roots where the helper owns every
  stylesheet. The widget's own rules are adopted as a second sheet right after
  the shared one, which keeps the old order.
- `sharedStylesLink()` — a `<link>` rendered as the first node of a lit
  template, for roots that keep a `<style>` of their own. Tree order is
  preserved exactly.

Swapping one for the other on the wrong root silently changes which rules win.

## Where the bytes are

`npm run measure` lists the longest string literals in each bundle. After the
extraction, `content.js` has about 104 KB of literals across 23 strings: the
lit-html template texts of the widgets, the settings metadata and inline SVG.
No single one is over 16 KB. The rest is feature code.

## "Lighten the Intra" (Advanced tab)

These three settings are about the **Intra page**, not about this extension.
They cannot shrink `content.js`, which loads before any setting is read; what
they do is remove work the browser would otherwise do for the page itself. All
three are on by default and each can be turned off on its own.

- **Skip off-screen content** — `content-visibility: auto` on the repeated rows
  of the long cards (projects, achievements, logtime months), so
  the browser stops laying out and painting what is scrolled out of sight. On a
  synthetic page of 400 rows, 90 % of the body's elements sit inside a deferred
  block. Every target is inside a fixed-height `md:h-96` card with its own
  scrollbar, so a wrong size estimate can only move that card's scrollbar, never
  the page. Guarded by `@supports`, so Firefox before 125 simply skips it.
  The evaluation rows are left out on purpose: each hosts an inline
  `position: fixed` tooltip that containment would clip (1.12.1).
- **Pause when the tab is hidden** — stops the page's CSS animations and
  transitions while you are looking at another tab. It cannot pause an animated
  GIF; CSS has no say over those.
- **Connect early to the image server** — a `preconnect` to `cdn.intra.42.fr`,
  which saves the DNS, TCP and TLS round trips on the first avatar, typically
  100 to 300 ms on a cold connection.

There used to be a fourth, **Load images when needed**, which added
`loading="lazy"` to the page's images once they were in the document. It never
deferred a download: the browser decides lazy or eager when the request starts,
and React sets `src` on an image before inserting it, so the request is already
under way when any observer sees the element. Chrome 153 and Firefox 156
fetched every late image with and without it; the attribute only works when it
is set before `src`. It was removed in 1.14 together with its document-wide
observer and the layout read each pass cost. The stored key is kept and ignored.

The extension also does less itself than it used to: the profile pass ignores
bursts of DOM changes that only contain its own writes, the polling timers are
gone (about 260 timer wake-ups per page load replaced by five observers and four
one-shot deadlines), and the start-up path makes roughly 24 fewer storage
round-trips.

## Measuring locally

```bash
npm run build:firefox   # or build:chrome; measure only reads built output
npm run measure         # per-file raw + gzip, and the biggest literals
npm run check:size      # same report, exits 1 if a file is over budget
```

With nothing built, `npm run measure` prints `nothing built, nothing checked`
and exits 0; `npm run check:size` prints the same line and exits **1**, because
"I could not look" must never read as "it passed".

The literal scan does not parse JavaScript — it jumps from quote to matching
quote and drops overlaps. It is a map of what fills a bundle, not an accounting
statement; the sizes it prints will not add up to the file exactly.

## The budget rule

`scripts/measure-bundle.js` holds one `BUDGETS_KB` constant: a ceiling per built
file, including the stylesheets. CI runs `npm run check:size` after both builds,
so a pull request that pushes a file past its ceiling goes red.

A budget is a tripwire, not a target. Raising one is allowed and sometimes right
— but only in the same commit as the feature that needs the room, with the
reason in the commit message. Never raise a budget to make CI green.
